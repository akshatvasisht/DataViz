# Architecture Documentation

This document describes the system architecture, components, and data flow for the Big Ten fight song visualization project.

---

## Glossary
* **Manifold:** A topological structure representing connected regions in high-dimensional space where data points share similar characteristics
* **Winning Manifold:** A connected loop of schools that have both high spirit scores and high win rates, representing the "sweet spot" of successful feature combinations
* **Dead Zones:** Feature combinations that historically fail, appearing as isolated regions or disconnected components in the visualization where schools with low performance metrics cluster
* **Mapper Graph:** A network representation generated by TDA that preserves topological features of the high-dimensional data
* **Isolated Component:** Disconnected regions in the graph representing feature combinations associated with lower performance metrics
* **Connected Component:** Subgraphs where nodes exhibit similar feature profiles

## System Overview

The system implements a pipeline architecture consisting of data preprocessing, feature extraction, topological analysis, and visualization generation. The workflow executes in Google Colab, producing a standalone HTML file for static hosting.

## Technology Stack

| Category | Technology | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Language** | Python | Required for KeplerMapper and data processing libraries |
| **TDA Library** | KeplerMapper | Generates mapper graphs from high-dimensional data |
| **Environment** | Google Colab | Browser-based execution without local installation |
| **Visualization** | HTML/JavaScript | Standalone output for static hosting |
| **Hosting** | GitHub Pages | Static file hosting |

## Data Flow
1.  **Input:** FiveThirtyEight fight song dataset (CSV) containing school names, lyrics, and song metrics
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Three additional features are added via lyrical analysis: Aggression_Score, Complexity_Score, and Cliché_Score (1-10 scale)
3.  **Feature Vector Construction:** Each school is represented as a point in high-dimensional space using tempo, lyrical scores, and other song characteristics
4.  **Topological Analysis:** KeplerMapper applies TDA to construct a mapper graph that preserves topological relationships in the data
5.  **Output:** Interactive HTML file containing a network visualization with nodes colored by win percentage and hover interactions displaying statistics

## Design Constraints
* **Static Output:** The visualization is a standalone HTML file rather than a dynamic web application to simplify hosting and ensure reproducibility
* **Feature Extraction:** Lyrical analysis is performed manually using LLM rather than automated audio processing to reduce computational complexity
* **Execution Environment:** Google Colab is used to eliminate local installation requirements, at the cost of some development workflow features
